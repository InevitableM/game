# Nginx configuration for React Single Page Application (SPA)
#
# PROBLEM: React Router uses client-side routing (e.g., /snake, /wordle)
# If user directly visits http://app.com/snake, nginx won't find a /snake file
#
# SOLUTION: Always serve index.html for any route, let React Router handle it

server {
    # Listen on port 80 (standard HTTP)
    listen 80;

    # Server name (use _ for any hostname)
    server_name _;

    # Root directory where our built React files are
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Default file to serve
    index index.html;

    # Main location block - handles all requests
    location / {
        # Try to serve the requested file directly
        # If not found, serve index.html (for React Router)
        #
        # $uri         = try exact file (e.g., /static/js/main.js)
        # $uri/        = try as directory
        # /index.html  = fallback to index.html for SPA routing
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Cache static assets for better performance
    location /static/ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }

    # Gzip compression for faster loading
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml;
    gzip_min_length 1000;
}
